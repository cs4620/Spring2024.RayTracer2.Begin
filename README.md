# Terminology

## Vector
A direction in space

## Vertex 
A position in space

## Normalized Vector (Unit Vector)
A vector is length 1.
How? Divide all the components by the vector length.

# Ray
An infinite line that has an orgin, but no end.
r_o+r_d*T or r_x+r_dx*T+r_y+r_dy*T+r_z+r_dz*T

# Infinite Line
Ax+By+Cz+D=0
(A,B,C)\cdot (x,y,z)
D = -(A,B,C)\cdot (x,y,z)

# Normal/Perpendicular/The Orthogonal Vector
v\cdot u=0 iff they are perpendicular, etc.

# Infinite Plane
Ax+By+Cz+D=0
